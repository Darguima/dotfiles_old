# .dotfiles

Finally after 3 years of Linux and many Linux distros I created my `.dotfiles`.

## Installing

### Clone the repo

###### Only install it if you've cloned it inside `~/.dotfiles`, otherwise you'll run into problems.

```
git clone https://github.com/Darguima/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles

// or

git clone git@github.com:Darguima/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Run the install script:

```
~/.dotfiles/install.py
```

## Packages

At this moment, this are the installed and configured packages:

1) yay
2) zsh
3) awesome
3) alacritty
